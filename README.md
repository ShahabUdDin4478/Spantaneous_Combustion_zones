# Spantaneous_Combustion_zones
Normalize burn ratio Thermal (NBRT) shows high temperature/ wildfire zones. In this case, fire zones are spantaneous combustion (underground coal fire) zones that are responsible for the higher temperature of the rocks at surface. NBRT detects the anamoly in the temperature of rocks and it can be visualized as the yellow color once the code is run in Google Earth Engine.
Density Slicing Algorithm: It is also known as thresholding and it works on detecting/differentiating high temperature rocks from the surrounding low temperature rocks. In this method a threshold is selected and then the algorithm shows the temperature values higher than that threshold. Different therholds are tried in the algorithm that are represented in different colors, each corresponding to rock types having temperature >= to the threshold.
